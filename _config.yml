about_content: |
  Master’s student at Freie Universität Berlin (Interdisciplinary Studies of the Middle East), focusing on computational linguistics and digital text analysis. My work involves processing historical Arabic, Persian, and Chinese corpora using OCR, NLP, and vector-based methods. I build tools for semantic retrieval, layout processing, and long-range comparison of textual structures. Interested in open-source, reproducible pipelines, and applications of machine learning to classical texts.

        description: |
          Built a simple tool to transcribe and clean audio interviews for an internal project. Used a Hugging Face wav2vec2 model for Russian speech recognition, followed by a language model to improve readability: punctuation, minor corrections, and layout structuring. The tool was used to process a specific batch of interview recordings for internal documentation purposes.
