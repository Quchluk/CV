about_content: |
  Master‚Äôs student at Freie Universit√§t Berlin (Interdisciplinary Studies of the Middle East), focusing on computational linguistics and digital text analysis. My work involves processing historical Arabic, Persian, and Chinese corpora using OCR, NLP, and vector-based methods. I build tools for semantic retrieval, layout processing, and long-range comparison of textual structures. Interested in open-source, reproducible pipelines, and applications of machine learning to classical texts.

          Built a simple tool to transcribe and clean audio interviews for an internal project. Used a Hugging Face wav2vec2 model for Russian speech recognition, followed by a language model to improve readability: punctuation, minor corrections, and layout structuring. The tool was used to process a specific batch of interview recordings for internal documentation purposes.
