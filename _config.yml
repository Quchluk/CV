about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Computational linguist and digital humanities researcher working with OCR, historical corpora, NLP pipelines, and semantic change analysis. Strong focus on Arabic- and Persian-script languages.

  My research combines traditional linguistic approaches with modern computational methods to analyze historical texts and language evolution, particularly in Middle Eastern languages.

        title: Diachronic Semantic Clustering of Arabic
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Created a system for tracking semantic change in Arabic texts across different time periods. Utilized AraBERT for contextual embeddings, applied PCA for dimensionality reduction, and implemented KMeans clustering to identify semantic shifts. Developed visualization tools to track cosine similarity of terms over time.
