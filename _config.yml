about_content: |
  Masterâ€™s student at Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin (Interdisciplinary Studies of the Middle East), focusing on computational linguistics and digital text analysis. My work involves processing historical Arabic, Persian, and Chinese corpora using OCR, NLP, and vector-based methods. I build tools for semantic retrieval, layout processing, and long-range comparison of textual structures. Interested in open-source, reproducible pipelines, and applications of machine learning to classical texts.

      title: Hadith Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application
      sub_title: Personal Research Project â€” Berlin, Germany | April 2025 â€“ Present
      link: https://github.com/Quchluk/al-Bukhari-Hadith-RAG
      link_text: GitHub Repository
      description: |
        Application for semantic QA over the *Sahih al-Bukhari* corpus using embedding-based retrieval with citation traceability. Accepts natural-language questions and returns relevant passages with structured metadata.

        â€¢ Embedding + Retrieval: FAISS, OpenAI embeddings (ada-002), LangChain RetrievalQA  
        â€¢ LLM: GPT-3.5  
        â€¢ UI: Streamlit with inline citations and session memory  
        â€¢ Data: JSON corpus with book/chapter/number metadata  
        â€¢ Output: Citation-linked answers for research and verification

      link_text: GitHub Repository
      description: |
        Extension of the Bukhari pipeline to larger multi-volume hadith collections (e.g., Muslim, Tirmidhi). Focus on efficient indexing and multilingual support.

        â€¢ Data: Parquet format with structured metadata  
        â€¢ Retrieval: ChromaDB + OpenAI embeddings  
        â€¢ UI: Streamlit with language filters and search  
        â€¢ Focus: Performance, modularity, and extensibility for future corpora

      title: ASR & NLP Pipeline Assistant
      sub_title: Subcontract for FosAgro (via third party)
      caption: 2023
      description: |
        Built a processing chain for internal audio interviews. Used an off-the-shelf ASR model to transcribe Russian speech, followed by a language model for text cleanup: inserting punctuation, correcting errors, and restoring missing words. Final output was structured into readable layout blocks for reporting. The tool allowed users to upload audio and receive clean, formatted interview text.
