about_content: |
  Masterâ€™s student at Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin (Interdisciplinary Studies of the Middle East), focusing on computational linguistics and digital text analysis. My work involves processing historical Arabic, Persian, and Chinese corpora using OCR, NLP, and vector-based methods. I build tools for semantic retrieval, layout processing, and long-range comparison of textual structures. Interested in open-source, reproducible pipelines, and applications of machine learning to classical texts.

      title: Hadith Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Application
      sub_title: Personal Research Project â€” Berlin, Germany | April 2025 â€“ Present
      link: https://github.com/Quchluk/al-Bukhari-Hadith-RAG
      link_text: GitHub Repository
      description: |
        Web interface for semantic question-answering over the *Sahih al-Bukhari* corpus with citation-linked outputs. Enables researchers to explore classical Islamic texts through natural-language queries.

        â€¢ RAG stack: FAISS + OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002), LangChain RetrievalQA with GPT-3.5  
        â€¢ Frontend: Streamlit with inline citations, memory, and feedback  
        â€¢ Corpus: Cleaned JSON with metadata (book, chapter, number)  
        â€¢ Impact: Makes 9th-century Islamic sources explorable with modern NLP tools

      sub_title: Independent Project â€” Berlin, Germany | May 2025 â€“ Present
      link: https://github.com/Quchluk/HadithView
      link_text: GitHub Repository
      description: |
        Interface for manual exploration of hadith corpora by structured metadata. Designed for cross-checking RAG system outputs and identifying alignment issues.

        â€¢ Data Layer: Parquet + pandas  
        â€¢ UI: Streamlit with lightweight controls  
        â€¢ Use Case: Facilitates validation and training of QA systems on religious corpora

      title: HadithRAG â€” Scalable QA for Multi-Volume Hadith Collections
      sub_title: Independent Project â€” Berlin, Germany | May 2025 â€“ Present
      link: https://github.com/Quchluk/HadithRAG
      link_text: GitHub Repository
      description: |
        Extends the Bukhari pipeline to larger collections (e.g. Muslim, Tirmidhi). Handles multilingual input and scalable corpus sizes.

        â€¢ Storage: Parquet files with language-agnostic indexing  
        â€¢ Retrieval: ChromaDB + OpenAI embedding-based vector search  
        â€¢ UI: Streamlit with filterable metadata  
        â€¢ Result: Modular design for future DH/NLP applications

      sub_title: Independent Project â€” Berlin, Germany | May 2025 â€“ Present
      link: https://github.com/Quchluk/OCRmyPDF-RAG-Assistant
      link_text: GitHub Repository
      description: |
        End-to-end pipeline for semantic QA over scanned academic PDFs. Combines OCR, chunking, embedding, and source-linked retrieval.

        â€¢ OCR & Layout: OCRmyPDF, Tesseract, PyMuPDF  
        â€¢ Search: ChromaDB, OpenAI embeddings, LangChain RetrievalQA  
        â€¢ Goal: Answer scholarly questions and trace responses to original scanned pages  
        â€¢ Outcome: Research-ready prototype for working with academic archives

      title: ASR & NLP Pipeline Assistant
      sub_title: Subcontract for FosAgro (via third party)
      caption: 2023
      description: |
        Worked on a processing pipeline for audio interviews. Used a speech recognition model to transcribe Russian recordings. Then applied a language model to improve the text: fixing errors, adding missing words, and inserting punctuation. Finally, applied a layout model to structure the text into readable interview format. As a result, users could upload raw audio and receive a clean, formatted transcript.
