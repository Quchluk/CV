        link_text: GitHub Repository
        description: |
          Built a full-stack RAG system for semantic question answering over the Sahih al-Bukhari hadith corpus, with source-linked answers and interactive UI.

          **Goals:**
          â€¢ Natural-language querying of classical Islamic texts  
          â€¢ Source-based scholarly citation  
          â€¢ Scalable RAG pipeline with accessible interface

          **Key Components:**
          â€¢ Vector DB & Embeddings: FAISS + OpenAI (text-embedding-ada-002), metadata-indexed  
          â€¢ RAG Pipeline: LangChain RetrievalQA + GPT-3.5-turbo  
          â€¢ Frontend: Streamlit app with citation-rich UI and session memory  
          â€¢ Data Handling: Cleaned JSON corpus with structured metadata  
          â€¢ Tech Stack: Python, langchain, streamlit, faiss-cpu, dotenv, openai
